Here's the badge that shows a "passing" evaluation from Travis
https://travis-ci.org/Archimedes2kxx/farspack3.svg?branch=master
 
Coursera/JHU student graders should note the commit that adds the link to the passing badge to this ReadMe causes Travis to do another build ... which results in another "pass", i.e., whiich has a different link ... which when added to the ReadMe would cause another Travis build, etc, etc, etc. There's probaby a way to tell Travis not to include changes to ReadMe, but I don't know what it is at this time
